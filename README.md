# Smooth Navigation with Animated Page Transitions

This project features a sleek, animated navigation menu and smooth page transitions using modern animation tools. It was built as part of my GSAP learning journey, combining multiple libraries to create a fluid, responsive user experience.

## ðŸŽ¬ Features

- Animated navigation menu with GSAP
- Smooth scrolling experience using Lenis
- Seamless page transitions with Next.js View Transitions API
- Lightweight routing animations for improved UX

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This is a personal practice project, created to experiment with animation techniques and transitions in a Next.js environment. It's not intended as a production-ready build, but a sandbox for improving animation fluency and layout flow.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- [Lenis](https://github.com/studio-freight/lenis) â€“ Smooth scrolling
- [Next View Transitions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/view-transitions)
